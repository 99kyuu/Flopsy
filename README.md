## Details
The animation is made using [Adobe After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html), exported using [BodyMovin](https://aescripts.com/bodymovin/),
rendered using [Lottie](https://airbnb.design/lottie/) and controlled using Lottie's [Animation Segments](http://airbnb.io/lottie/android/android.html#play-animation-segments)

## Comments
Since I'm a terrible animator, feel free to edit it for your needs.
Thank you! üê∞
